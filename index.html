  <p class="lead text colour"> Hi! I'm Mel, Welcome to my website. I am currently a first year Undergrad Digital Media Student studying at UWE Bristol. I love anything to do with nature photography and absolutely love going on adventures and exploring new places. I have also recently started to enjoy car photography. There are some examples of both types of photography above. You can also look at some of the projects I have done throughout my years of education. More will be added as I go along my journey, enjoy!</p>

I went with a colour scheme of red, black and white and kept that idea throughout all three designs to allow for them to be displayed as a set, but also give the option for them to be displayed individually. </h1>

<div class="container py-3">
  <p class="lead text colour"> For this website, I used Figma and created a design which can be viewed on both desktop and mobile. What I wanted to achieve when making this website was a creative outlet for my projects and to be able to display them in an accessible way for a lot of people. 
 I enjoyed this HTML and CSS project as it allowed for me to be able to understand the fundamentals in creating a website. It did take me a few go's to understand how everything links together and it took me a lot of trail and error to get my website to look and run how I wanted it to. I used parts of my Figma Web Design to create my final Webpage but decided not to go with multiple pages to avoid any confusion and a possible non-working site. Because of how new I am to this type of coding style, I felt that it was best to simplify my designs to achieve the expected criteria without losing the quality of work.    </p>

<div class="container py-3">
  <p class="lead text colour"> I used AI to help me with implementing some of my CSS code. For example, it helped me be able to change the background of my website correctly, as well as adding a red box behind my title. I also used it to help me be able to understand how to link my desired fonts correctly. When my title did not shrink to size when at an iphone format, I used the guidance to be able to fix it. I had the width and height of the text set at a certain size which meant it did not follow the bootstrap structure. Once removed, it worked correctly. After using the guidance from ChatGPT once, I was able to follow the same steps for most of my CSS code.  </p>
